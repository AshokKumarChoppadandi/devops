Kubernetes:

Kubernetes coordinates a highly available cluster of computers that are connected to work as a single unit. The abstractions in Kubernetes allow you to deploy containerized applications to a cluster without tying them specifically to individual machines. 

Kubernetes automates the distribution and scheduling of application containers across a cluster in a more efficient way. Kubernetes is an open-source platform and is production-ready.

A Kubernetes cluster consists of two types of resources:

    * The CONTROL PLANE coordinates the cluster
    * NODES are the workers that run applications

CONTROL PLANE:

    * The Control Plane is responsible for managing the cluster. 
    * The Control Plane coordinates all activities in your cluster, such as scheduling applications, maintaining applications' desired state, scaling applications, and rolling out new updates.

NODES:

    * A node is a VM or a physical computer that serves as a worker machine in a Kubernetes cluster.
    * Each node has a Kubelet, which is an agent for managing the node and communicating with the Kubernetes control plane.
    * The node should also have tools for handling container operations, such as containerd or Docker.

Note:

    A Kubernetes cluster that handles production traffic should have a minimum of three nodes because if one node goes down, both an etcd member and a control plane instance are lost, and redundancy is compromised. You can mitigate this risk by adding more control plane nodes.

FLOW:

    * When a user deploy applications on Kubernetes, the user tell the control plane to start the application containers.
    * The control plane schedules the containers to run on the cluster's nodes.
    * The nodes communicate with the control plane using the Kubernetes API, which the control plane exposes.
